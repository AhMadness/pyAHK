We can add a toggle key that allows us to pause/resume script without aborting it, or exit script key, or an info key that shows our key mappings for our saved script.

After clicking on "Add mapping", we can see our hotkey function in the Key Mappings display screen and the AHK script in its display.

And finally we can save the script directly as an ahk file or build it as an exe.
